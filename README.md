# MouseWheelFixer

An executable version of this software, `wheel.exe`, is available in the `dist` folder. It includes the `mouse.ico` as its icon.

**Important Note:** Due to the nature of how Python scripts are converted into executables, `wheel.exe` may be flagged by antivirus software (such as Windows Defender) as a potential threat. This is often a false positive. If you encounter such a warning, please allow the executable to run or add an exclusion for it in your antivirus settings to use the software.
